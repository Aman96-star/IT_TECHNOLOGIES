------------------------------------------------------------
PAYMENT BROKER APPS
------------------------------------------------------------

=> Acts as a bridge between:
   - E-commerce apps
   - Payment gateways

=> Takes card details from e-commerce apps
=> Routes payment to appropriate payment gateway

Examples:
- PayU Money
- PayTM
- Razorpay
- PhonePe


------------------------------------------------------------
PAYMENT GATEWAY APPS
------------------------------------------------------------

=> Provide worldwide infrastructure for payments
=> Issue debit/credit cards via banks

Examples:
- VISA
- MasterCard
- Maestro
- RuPay
- Cirrus


============================================================
JEE FRAMEWORKS / APPLICATION FRAMEWORKS
============================================================

=> Provide abstraction on:
   - Java language
   - JEE technologies
   - Java frameworks

=> Used to develop:
   - Standalone applications
   - Web applications
   - Distributed applications
   - Enterprise applications


------------------------------------------------------------
SPRING FRAMEWORK
------------------------------------------------------------

Spring -> From Interface21 (Pivotal team)
Spring Boot -> From Interface21 (Pivotal team)


=> Using Spring / Spring Boot we can develop:
   - Standalone apps
   - Web apps
   - Distributed apps
   - Enterprise apps


============================================================
ARCHITECTURE TYPES USING SPRING
============================================================

1) Monolith Architecture
2) Microservice Architecture


============================================================
MONOLITH ARCHITECTURE
============================================================

=> All services of a project are developed and packaged
   into a SINGLE unit (jar / war file)

Example:
BankApp.jar
  |
  |-- Daily Transactions Module
  |-- Loans Module
  |-- Insurance Module
  |-- Payroll Module


Analogy:
=> Like buying TV with built-in:
   - Home Theatre
   - PlayStation
   - DTH


------------------------------------------------------------
LIMITATIONS OF MONOLITH ARCHITECTURE
------------------------------------------------------------

a) If one module/service goes down,
   entire application is affected

b) All modules must use:
   - Same language
   - Same technology
   - Same framework

c) Code base becomes complex and tightly coupled

d) Other projects cannot reuse individual services easily


============================================================
MICROSERVICE ARCHITECTURE
============================================================

=> Different services are developed as DIFFERENT projects

=> Each project represents ONE SERVICE
=> Each service is called a MICROSERVICE

=> Microservices are integrated using:
   - Third-party tools
   - Network communication


------------------------------------------------------------
MICROSERVICE EXAMPLE
------------------------------------------------------------

Daily Transactions (Microservice #1) -> jar/war
Loans              (Microservice #2) -> jar/war
Insurance          (Microservice #3) -> jar/war
Payroll            (Microservice #4) -> jar/war


Analogy:
=> Like ordering food separately
=> Like purchasing TV, speaker, console independently
   and integrating as needed


------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTE
------------------------------------------------------------

Microservices = Web Services ++


============================================================
ADVANTAGES OF MICROSERVICE ARCHITECTURE
============================================================

=> Failure of one service does NOT affect other services

=> Modifications in one service do NOT impact others

=> Different microservices can be developed using:
   - Different languages
   - Different technologies
   - Different frameworks

=> Other projects can reuse any microservice easily

=> Better scalability
=> Easier maintenance
=> Faster development cycles


============================================================
SPRING BOOT + MICROSERVICES
============================================================

=> Spring Boot is widely used to develop microservices

=> Each microservice is:
   - Independent
   - Deployable separately
   - Scalable individually
