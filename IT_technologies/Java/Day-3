🔹 JDK vs JRE vs JVM vs Compiler
1. JDK (Java Development Kit)
Developer version (for writing + compiling + running Java programs).

Includes:

Compiler (javac) → Converts source code → bytecode

Java launcher (java) → Runs bytecode

Debugger, Profiler, Documentation tools, etc.

Contains JRE inside it.

— -

2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
Press enter or click to view image in full size

Client version (only for running Java programs, not for development).

Includes:

JVM

Class libraries (e.g., java.lang, java.util)

Does not include compiler (javac).

From Java 11 onwards, JRE folder is removed (JDK is enough).

— -

3. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

Software engine that executes Java bytecode.

Platform-dependent (Windows JVM, Linux JVM, etc.) but bytecode is platform-independent.

Responsibilities:

Class loading

Bytecode verification

Memory allocation

Garbage collection

Security

4. Compiler (javac) vs Interpreter (inside JVM)

Feature Compiler (javac) Interpreter (JVM)

Input Java Source Code (.java) Bytecode (.class)
Output Bytecode (.class) Machine Code
Execution Style Translates entire program once. Executes line-by-line (bytecode → native).
Speed Compilation is slower, but execution is faster. Execution is slower (line-by-line).
Errors Shows all errors at once (compile-time). Shows one error at runtime.
Portability Depends on JVM later. Directly OS dependent (through JVM).

🔹 Note: Java uses both:

Compiler (javac) → source → bytecode

Interpreter (JVM) → bytecode → machine code

Modern JVMs also use JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler for faster execution (it converts frequently used bytecode into native machine code at runtime).

✅ Quick Example:

// Source Code
public class Demo {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println(“Hello, Welcome to Java!”);
}
}

Execution steps:
1. javac Demo.java → Demo.class (Bytecode)
2. java Demo → JVM interprets bytecode → Native machine code → Output.
