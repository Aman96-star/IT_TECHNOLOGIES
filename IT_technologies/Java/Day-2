# Pass Parameters to a Function?

We pass parameters (arguments) to functions in order to provide complete information required by the function to perform its task.

👉 If we don’t pass parameters, the function may not have enough data to work with (incomplete / partial information).

Examples in Java:

public void doSum(int x, int y) // x and y are parameters
public void deposit(double amount) // amount is parameter
public void sleep(int hours) // hours is parameter

Here, each function requires external data to work properly.

# Why Functions are Called Methods in Java?
In C and C++, functions can be written:

Inside a class

Outside a class (using scope resolution operator ::)

Example in C++:

class Test {
void m1(); // Function declaration inside class
};

void Test::m1() {
// Function definition outside class using ::
}

👉 But in Java, every function must be written inside a class.
That’s why functions are called Methods in Java.
Example in Java:

class Test {
public void m1() {
System.out.println(“This is a method in Java”);
}
}

So, in Java there is no concept of global functions outside classes.

What is Platform Independence in Java?
C / C++ Case (Platform Dependent)

A program compiled on one machine may not run on another machine with different configuration.
Example:

Demo.c → Compiled → Demo.exe (Windows 32-bit)

This .exe may not run on Windows 64-bit or Linux.

This happens because .exe files are machine code generated for a specific OS and hardware.

Java Case (Platform Independent)
1. Write Program: Test.java (Source Code)

2. Compile Program (javac): Generates Test.class (Bytecode)

Compiler checks syntax

Ensures compatibility (LHS = RHS type checks)

Converts source code → Bytecode

3. Execute with JVM:

Test.class is submitted to Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

JVM interprets bytecode line by line into machine instructions

Each OS has its own JVM implementation:

Windows JVM

Linux JVM

Mac JVM

👉 Conclusion:
Java Language = Platform Independent (because bytecode can run anywhere).

JVM = Platform Dependent (each OS has its own JVM implementation).

⚡ Key Points to Remember:
C/C++ → Compiled into machine code → Platform Dependent

Java → Compiled into Bytecode → Runs on JVM → Platform Independent

JVM is written in C language, and it contains an interpreter for executing bytecode.
