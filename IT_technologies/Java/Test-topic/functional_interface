Problem Description
ou are required to write a Java program that demonstrates how to combine two Predicate conditions using the and() method from the java.util.function.Predicate interface.

Your task:

Accept an integer input N.

Create two predicates:

Predicate 1: Check if the number is even.

Predicate 2: Check if the number is greater than 10.

Combine both predicates using the and() method.

Evaluate the input number using the combined predicate.

Print whether the number satisfies both conditions.

Examples
Example 1
Input:
12
Output:
Number satisfies both predicates: true
Explanation:
Predicate 1 returns true if the number is even. Predicate 2 returns true if the number is greater than 10. The and() method combines them so the number must satisfy both conditions. Example: Input: 12 Even? ✔ Greater than 10? ✔ Combined result: ✔

Constraints
Input must be an integer.
1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁹
You must use:
Predicate<Integer>
test()
and() method

Problem Description
You are required to write a Java program that demonstrates the use of the
java.util.function.Function<T, R> functional interface with either:

A lambda expression, OR

A method reference

Your task is to:

Create an Emp class with:

int empNo

String name

float salary

Read employee details from user input.

Create a Function<Emp, Float> to:

Add ₹5000.00 bonus to the employee's salary.

Return the updated salary.

Apply the function and print the latest salary.

You may use either a lambda expression or a method reference.

Examples
Example 1
Input:
101
Rahul
45000
Output:
Latest Salary: 50000.0

3. Test-LooseCouplingNotificationDemo

Problem Description
Create a Java program to demonstrate loose coupling and polymorphism using an interface and its implementing classes.

You must define an interface NotificationHub that contains two abstract methods:
sendAlert() and sendReport().

Create two classes that implement this interface:

EmailNotification

SMSNotification

Each class must provide its own version of alert and report messages.

In the ELC class, write a static polymorphic method named:

"processNotification"

This method should call the two interface methods (sendAlert() and sendReport()) based on the object passed.
This proves loose coupling because the method works with any class implementing the interface.

In the main method:

Take user input (email or sms)

Create the corresponding object

Pass it to the static polymorphic method

The correct class’s methods must execute based on the object provided

This demonstrates how polymorphism removes direct dependency on specific classes and enables loose coupling.

Examples
Example 1
Input:
email
Output:
Email Alert Sent
Email Report Generated
