Problem Description
Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of the and() method of BiPredicate.
The program should check whether an employee is eligible based on age and experience.

Functional Interface Used

Interface name : BiPredicate

Type parameters :

First parameter : Integer (age)

Second parameter : Integer (experience in years)

Return type : boolean

ELC Class

Class name : BiPredicateAndDemo

Main Program

Create a BiPredicate<Integer, Integer> to check whether the employee age is greater than or equal to 21.

Create another BiPredicate<Integer, Integer> to check whether the employee experience is greater than or equal to 2 years.

Combine both conditions using the and() method.

Test the combined predicate with different scenarios.

Display the eligibility result for each scenario.

Eligibility Logic

An employee is eligible if:

Age ≥ 21 AND

Experience ≥ 2 years

Examples
Example 1
Input:
Age: 25
Experience: 3
Output:
true
Explanation:
Based on the test cases develop the program here two times BiPredicate required one for age and one for experience.

3. Display Prime Numbers Using Consumer and Lambda Expression
Easy
100 points
• 120 min suggested
Problem Description
Use the Consumer<int[]> functional interface.

Implement the logic using a lambda expression.

The Consumer should:

Take an integer array as input.

Identify prime numbers from the array.

Display all prime numbers.

Do not create any extra methods for prime checking.

Examples
Example 1
Input:
First line: Integer N (number of elements)
Second line: N space-separated integers
Output:
Prime numbers are: <list of prime numbers>
Explanation:
Read the number of elements from the user. Store the elements in an integer array. Create a Consumer<int[]> using a lambda expression. Inside the lambda: Traverse the array. Skip numbers less than or equal to 1. Check divisibility to determine whether a number is prime. Display the number if it is prime. Invoke the Consumer method.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵ (number of elements)
-10⁶ ≤ array[i] ≤ 10⁶
Prime numbers are defined only for integers greater than 1.
Use only one Consumer.
No return value from the lambda expression.
