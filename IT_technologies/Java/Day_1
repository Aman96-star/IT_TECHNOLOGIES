# What is a Language?

A language is a medium of communication through which humans can express and understand ideas.

# What is a Programming Language?

A programming language is a medium through which a user communicates with a computer system.
It allows us to submit instructions to get the desired output.

Characteristics of a Programming Language

1. Syntax → The rules defined by that language

2. Semantics → The meaning / structure conveyed by the code

Example (English):

Syntax Rule: Subject + Verb + Object

✅ He is a boy. (Valid)

❌ He is a box. (Invalid in meaning)

# Security in Java Programming

Java provides two levels of verification:

1. Compiler Level — — — Checks syntax (rules).

Reports syntax errors but does not care about execution meaning.

2. Execution Level (Runtime Environment) — — — Checks semantics (meaning).

If code is meaningless, throws Runtime Error.

👉 Final Conclusion:
Compiler → verifies Syntax

Runtime Environment (JVM) → verifies Semantics
