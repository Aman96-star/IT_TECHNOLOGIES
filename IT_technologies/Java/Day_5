JIT Compiler (Just-In-Time Compiler)
Part of the JVM execution engine.
Purpose: Improve performance of Java programs at runtime.
🔹 How JVM works without JIT:
JVM uses an interpreter, which executes bytecode line by line.
This makes execution slow.
🔹 How JIT works:
JIT compiles frequently used methods/instructions (called hotspots) into native machine code.
Instead of interpreting repeatedly, the JIT compiler stores compiled machine code.
At execution time, JVM directly executes the native machine code → faster performance.
Variable in Java
A variable is a name given for a memory location.
It can hold some meaningful value within its range.
A variable’s value can change during program execution.
Example:
int x = 10;
int y = 20;
x = x + y;
Memory Representation (RAM Example):
x → stores value at address (e.g., 1002).

y → stores value at address (e.g., 1006).
Word Breakdown:
Variable = “Vary + able” → changeable.
✅ Key Points:

JIT Compiler = improves performance by compiling bytecode into machine code at runtime.
Variable = named memory location whose value can change during execution.
🔹 Drawbacks of an Ordinary Variable
A variable can store only one value at a time.
int x = 12, 90; // Invalid

Stored in random memory location.
Volatile → when program ends, variable’s value is deleted from memory.
👉 To store permanently, we use File Handling.
🔹 What is Data Type?
Definition: Specifies the type of data a variable can store.
Describes:
Size — memory required in RAM.
Range — values it can hold. (Example: byte → -128 to 127).
operations — allowed operations (addition, string concatenation, etc.).
🔹 Types of Data in Java
Java has 2 main categories:

1. Primitive Data Type
Also called: primary, predefined, basic, fundamental, atomic, intrinsic.

Total: 8 types
Numeric/Integral
byte (8 bits)
short (16 bits)
int (32 bits)
long (64 bits)
Decimal
float (32 bits)
double (64 bits)
Non-Numeric
char (16 bits)
boolean (1 bit or depends on JVM)
2. Reference Data Type
Examples: class, array, interface, enum, record, etc.

✅ Summary:

Ordinary variables → store only one value, temporary.
Data type → defines size, range, and operations of data.
Java has 8 primitive data types and reference data types.
🔹 Statically Typed vs Dynamically Typed Languages
Statically Typed Language
Data type must be declared before using a variable.
Once declared, the variable holds the same type of value till program ends.
Example: C, C++, Java (JSE), C#
👉 Example in Java:

int x = 10;  // must declare int
x = "Hello"; // ❌ not allowed
Dynamically Typed Language
Data type not required when declaring variables.
Variable can hold different types of values during execution.
Exaple: Python, JavaScript, Visual Basic
👉 Example in Python:

x = 10
x = "Hello"  # ✅ allowed
🔹 Comments in Java
Used to make code readable.
Ignored by the compiler.
Types of Comments:
Single-line Comment
// This is a single-line comment

Multi-line Comment
/* This is a multi-line comment */
Documentation Comment (for projects & APIs)
/** * Name of Project: Online Shopping * Modules: 70 * Project Date: 12th March 2024 * Last Modified: 9th Sep 2025 * Author: James Goling and his friends */

✅ Summary:

Statically typed → type fixed (C, Java).
Dynamically typed → type flexible (Python, JavaScript).
Comments → make code readable (3 types: single, multi, documentation).
