What is a JOIN?
// important concept

JOIN is used when data is stored in more than one table and we want to see it together.

📌 Example

EMP table → employee details

DEPT table → department details

To see employee name + department name, we must JOIN the tables.

Important Rule (Very Easy)

👉 If you join n tables, you need n − 1 join conditions.

Tables	Join Conditions
2 tables	1 condition
3 tables	2 conditions
EQUI JOIN

🔹 Meaning: Join using =` (equal to) operator
🔹 Columns must have same datatype
🔹 Returns only matching rows

Example (Old Oracle style – 8i)
SELECT e.ename, d.dname
FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno;


✔ Shows employees only if deptno matches
❌ If deptno = 40 exists only in DEPT, it will not show

INNER JOIN

🔹 Works same as EQUI JOIN
🔹 Returns only matching rows
🔹 Uses ANSI syntax (Oracle 9i+)
🔹 Better readability and performance

Example
SELECT e.ename, d.dname
FROM emp e
INNER JOIN dept d
ON e.deptno = d.deptno;


📌 Result is SAME as Equi Join

Important Note (Interview Point ⭐)

✅ Equi Join = Inner Join
Only difference is syntax, not result.

8i Joins (NON-ANSI Joins)

🔹 Old Oracle syntax
🔹 Join condition written in WHERE clause

Syntax
SELECT col1, col2
FROM table1, table2
WHERE table1.common_col = table2.common_col;


📌 Example

SELECT e.ename, d.dname
FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno;

9i Joins (ANSI Joins)

🔹 New and recommended syntax
🔹 Join condition written using JOIN … ON

Syntax
SELECT col1, col2
FROM table1
JOIN table2
ON table1.common_col = table2.common_col;


📌 Example

SELECT e.ename, d.dname
FROM emp e
JOIN dept d
ON e.deptno = d.deptno;

Using Table Aliases (Very Important 👍)

🔹 Alias = short name for table
🔹 Improves performance & readability
🔹 Must use alias in SELECT and ON

Example
SELECT e.ename, d.dname
FROM emp e
JOIN dept d
ON e.deptno = d.deptno;


✔ e → emp
✔ d → dept

Simple One-Line Summary

JOIN → combine tables

Equi Join → = operator, old style

Inner Join → same result, new style

8i Join → WHERE clause

9i Join → JOIN … ON

Aliases → faster, cleaner queries

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Write a query to display the employee names and their department names from emp, dept tables.

SQL> select ename,Dname from emp E  inner join dept D on E.deptno=D.deptno ;

2.Write a query to display the employee names and their locations from emp, dept tables

SQL> select ename,LOC from emp E  inner join dept D on E.deptno=D.deptno ;

3.Write a query to display the employees who are working in the location CHICAGO 
  from emp,dept tables ?


SQL> select d.deptno,ename,LOC from emp E  inner join dept D on E.deptno=D.deptno where LOC='CHICAGO';

Note: If we want to filter the data after joining condition then we 
===== must use AND operator in 8i joins. where as in 9i joins we are
      using either AND operator or WHERE clause also.



4.Write a query to display no of employees in each location from emp, dept tables 
  by using equi join or inner join?

SQL> select d.deptno,ename,LOC from emp E  inner join dept D on E.deptno=D.deptno where LOC='CHICAGO';



5.Write a query to display dname, sum(Sal) from emp,dept tables by using 
  equi join or inner join?

SQL> select d.dname,sum(e.SAL) from emp E inner join dept D on E.deptno=D.deptno group by dname ;

6.Write a query to display department name and sum of salaries and whose sum of salaries
  is more than 9000 from emp,dept tables
   


7.Write a query to display BLAKE employee record along with department details
   from emp, dept tables?




8.Write a query to display student names and their corresponding faculty names
  from studentenrollment and faculty tables


SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENTENROLLMENT;

SNAME            FID
---------     ---------
GOWTHAM          1001
SUBBARAO         1001

ANUSHKA
KIRAN
SUBBARAO         1002
KAVYA            1003



SQL> SELECT * FROM FACULTY;

       FID           FNAME             SUBJECT         AGE
     -------    -----------------     ----------     --------
      1001           MURALI            ORACLE          38

      1003       SHIVA CHAITANYA       ORACLE          32


9.Write query to display the students names and along with their faculty name,subject,age.
  Show only the students who are assigned to faculty that teach the subject 'ORACLE'
  from the above 2 tables

  
10.Write an SQL query to display the student names(whose names start with 'S')
  along with their faculty name, subject, and age. 
  Return only the records where the faculty teaches the subject 'ORACLE'
  and their age between 35 and 40 from the above 2 tables.


11.Write query to display the students names and along with their faculty name,subject,age.
   Show only the students who are assigned to faculty that teach the subject 'CORE JAVA'


12.Write a SQL query to display[Cognizant Interview Question]

 The first_name and last_name and contact information of all passengers who have a
 boarding pass for a flight ID 5 and having Gluten-free meal preference from the
 following PASSENGER & BOARDINGPASS tables

 Your output should have three columns as given below
