1️⃣ What is an API?

API (Application Programming Interface)
👉 It allows one application to communicate with another application.

In React:

React app acts as a Consumer

Server / API acts as a Provider

📌 Flow:

Consumer (React App)  →  Request
Provider (API Server) →  JSON Response

2️⃣ REST API Basics

REST = Representational State Transfer

REST APIs use:

HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

URLs (Routes / Endpoints)

JSON data format

📌 REST Communication

Client sends request

Server sends response (mostly JSON)

3️⃣ FakeStore API

FakeStore API provides free REST APIs for practice with React.

🔗 Base URL
https://fakestoreapi.com/products

| Method | Route                           | Description                   |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| GET    | `/products`                     | Get all products              |
| GET    | `/products/categories`          | Get all categories            |
| GET    | `/products/category/{category}` | Products of specific category |
| GET    | `/products/{id}`                | Get product by ID             |

5️⃣ Product Data Format (JSON)
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Product Name",
  "price": 109.95,
  "description": "Product description",
  "rating": {
    "rate": 4.1
  }
}


📌 Important Fields

id → product id

title → product name

price → product price

description → product details

rating.rate → product rating

6️⃣ Fetching API Data in React
Common ways:

fetch() (JavaScript)

axios (library)

📌 Usually done inside:

useEffect() hook

Stored using useState()

7️⃣ UI Planning using Google Stitch

Google Stitch helps in UI idea generation.

📝 Prompt for Stitch:

Create a shopping home screen

Navbar at the top

Brand name

Search bar

Shortcut icons (cart, profile)

Featured products section

Product cards in 4 × 4 grid

Left panel filters

4
8️⃣ Suggested UI Structure (React)
App
 ├── Header (Navbar)
 ├── Section
 │    ├── Left Panel (Filters)
 │    └── Product Grid (Cards)
 └── Footer

9️⃣ Filters in UI

Left panel filters:

Filter by Category

Filter by Rating

Filter by Price Range

🔟 Style Binding in React (Inline Styling)

React supports inline styles using the style attribute.

Syntax:
<div style={{ backgroundColor: "lightblue", padding: "10px" }}>
  Product Card
</div>

Explanation:

Outer { } → React binding

Inner { } → JavaScript object

Style property names must be camelCase

1️⃣1️⃣ Style Rules in React

❌ Wrong:

background-color


✅ Correct:

backgroundColor

Common Style Properties:

backgroundColor

color

fontSize

margin

padding

borderRadius

✅ Summary

React consumes APIs using REST

FakeStore API is ideal for practice

API returns JSON data

UI should be planned before coding

Inline styles use camelCase

useEffect + useState are key for fetching data
