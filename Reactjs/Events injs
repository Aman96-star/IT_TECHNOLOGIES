1️⃣ What is an Event?

An event is a message sent by a sender to its subscriber
👉 to notify that something has happened or changed.

Examples of events:

Button click

Key press

Mouse move

Page load

🔹 Event follows Observer Pattern

Observer Pattern means:

One object notifies

Another object listens and reacts

✔️ In events:

Sender → sends notification

Subscriber → receives notification and performs action

🔹 Event uses Delegate Mechanism

A delegate is a reference to a function

When an event occurs, the function is called

In JavaScript, functions act like function pointers

🔹 Event Syntax
function DeleteClick() {
    // action
} // Subscriber

<button onclick="DeleteClick()">Delete</button>


Subscriber → defines action

Sender → triggers the action

2️⃣ What is an Event Handler?

An event handler is a function attached directly to an element in HTML.

👉 Event is configured at design time.

Example:
<button onclick="DeleteClick()">Delete</button>


on → handler

click → event

✔️ Simple but not recommended for dynamic elements

3️⃣ What is an Event Listener?

An event listener is a modern way to attach events using JavaScript.

Why Event Listeners?

Used for dynamic elements

Cleaner code

Multiple events possible

No HTML mixing

🔹 Syntax
element.addEventListener("click", function () {
    // action
});


✔️ Elements created dynamically must use event listeners

4️⃣ What are Event Arguments?

Event arguments carry payload (data) related to the event.

👉 Payload = data transferred from one place to another.

🔹 Default Event Arguments (2)

Events provide two default arguments:

a) this

Refers to the current element

Contains element details

this.id
this.name
this.className
this.value
this.src
this.href
this.width
this.height

b) event

Refers to the current event

Contains event details

event.clientX
event.clientY
event.keyCode
event.charCode
event.shiftKey

🔹 Syntax with Default Arguments
<button onclick="Name(this, event)">Click</button>

function Name(element, e) {
    element.id;
    element.value;

    e.clientX;
    e.clientY;
}

5️⃣ Custom Arguments

You can also pass custom arguments.

Custom only:
<button onclick="details(10, 20)">Click</button>

function details(a, b) {
    console.log(a, b);
}

Custom + Default:
<button onclick="details(this, event, 100)">Click</button>

function details(el, e, value) {
    console.log(el.id);
    console.log(e.type);
    console.log(value);
}

6️⃣ Event Listener Argument Rule

👉 Event listener accepts only ONE argument, which is event.

Syntax:
element.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
    e.clientX;
    e.clientY;

    e.target.id;
    e.target.name;
    e.target.value;
});


✔️ e.target gives element details
✔️ e gives event details

7️⃣ What is Event Propagation?

Event propagation is a mechanism where
👉 child events trigger parent events.

Meaning:

Event moves from child → parent

Child simulates parent behavior

This is called Event Bubbling.

🔹 Example:

Clicking a button inside a div triggers:

Button event

Div event

🔹 Stop Event Propagation

You can stop this using:

e.stopPropagation();

Example:
function ChildEvent(e) {
    e.stopPropagation();
}


✔️ Event stops at child only

8️⃣ Prevent Default Events

Some elements have default browser behavior:

Form submit

Link navigation

👉 Use:

e.preventDefault();

9️⃣ Event Loop

The event loop manages asynchronous events.

👉 It decides:

When an event runs

After call stack is empty

Used in:

setTimeout

Promises

Async code

🔟 Event Profiling

Event profiling means:

Measuring performance of event handlers

Finding slow events

👉 Done using Browser DevTools

🔑 Final One-Line Summary (Exam Ready)

Event → Notification of action

Handler → HTML-based event binding

Listener → JavaScript-based dynamic binding

Event Arguments → Data carried with event

Custom Arguments → User-defined data

Event Propagation → Child → Parent

stopPropagation() → Stops bubbling

preventDefault() → Stops browser action
