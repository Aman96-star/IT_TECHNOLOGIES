🔹 Enabling Bootstrap in React App

Bootstrap can be used in a React application to quickly design responsive UI.

1️⃣ Install Required Libraries

Run the following command in the project terminal:

npm i bootstrap bootstrap-icons


✔ Installs Bootstrap CSS, JS, and Icons inside node_modules

2️⃣ Link Bootstrap Files in main.jsx

Add the following imports at the top of main.jsx:

import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";
import "bootstrap-icons/font/bootstrap-icons.css";
import "bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.js";


✔ CSS → Styling
✔ JS bundle → Bootstrap components (modal, dropdown, etc.)

3️⃣ Use Bootstrap Classes in Components

You can use Bootstrap classes and components anywhere in the project.

Example:
<div className="alert alert-warning">
  Warning Message
</div>

<input className="form-control" />

<button className="btn btn-warning">
  Submit
</button>

4️⃣ Bootstrap Dynamic Attributes

Bootstrap uses data attributes for JavaScript-based components.

Common Attributes:

data-bs-target

data-bs-toggle

data-bs-dismiss

Example:
<button
  className="btn btn-danger"
  data-bs-toggle="modal"
  data-bs-target="#myModal">
  Open Modal
</button>

5️⃣ UI Design Help (Optional)

To get UI ideas, you can use Google Stitch:

Sample Prompt:

Create a shopping home page

Navbar at top with brand name, search bar & social icons

Featured product cards in 4×4 grid

Footer with contact & services

🔹 React Data Binding
What is Data Binding?

Data binding means connecting data (state/props) with the UI, so when data changes, the UI updates automatically.

📌 React uses binding expressions {}

Example:
var name = "John";

<p>Hello! {name}</p>

<input type="text" value={name} />

Key Points:

JavaScript needs many DOM methods for binding

React handles binding efficiently

React supports one-way data binding by default

🔹 One-Way vs Two-Way Binding
One-Way Binding (Default)

Data flows from state → UI

UI cannot change data automatically

Two-Way Binding

Requires explicit implementation

Mostly done using onChange + useState

🔹 Handling Data in React Components
Important Concepts:

React apps use HTTP protocol

HTTP is stateless

Data is not remembered between requests

❌ Not recommended:

var name = "John"; // Bad practice


✔ Recommended:

Use component local state

🔹 Local State in React
What is Local State?

Data that belongs to one component

Created when component is created

Used to store dynamic data

🔹 useState() Hook
What is a Hook?

Hook is predefined business logic

Provided by React

Used to access component state

useState() Definition
const [getter, setter] = useState(initialValue);


✔ Uses destructuring
✔ Returns:

Getter → reads state

Setter → updates state

Example:
const [price, setPrice] = useState(40);

🔹 FAQ on useState()
1️⃣ Can we use var or let for state?

✔ Yes
❌ Not recommended

2️⃣ Why use const for state?

State should not allow reassignment

var / let allow reassignment

const protects state reference

3️⃣ How can we update state if const is used?

❌ Invalid:

setPrice = 50; // ❌ Not allowed


✔ Valid:

setPrice(50); // ✅ Correct


👉 State is updated through setter function, not assignment

🔹 Summary

✔ Bootstrap is enabled via npm & imports
✔ React uses className, not class
✔ Data binding uses {}
✔ React supports one-way binding
✔ Component data must be stored in state
✔ useState() manages local state
