React Overview (Web & Mobile)
• React is a JavaScript Library
• Used to build User Interfaces (UI)
• Mainly used for Web Applications
• Focuses only on the View Layer
React Native is used to build Android APK and iOS applications.

Platforms
Web Applications → React
Mobile Applications (APK / iOS) → React Native

Features of React
1. Component-Based Architecture
• UI is divided into reusable components
• Easy to build and reuse UI
• Easy to maintain and extend
• Faster rendering and lightweight
Examples: Navbar, Slider, Carousel

2. JSX (JavaScript XML)
• JSX allows writing HTML inside JavaScript
• Makes code readable and shorter
• Improves performance
Example:
let name = "Tom";
<p>{name}</p>

3. Virtual DOM
• DOM stands for Document Object Model
• Updating real DOM is slow
• React uses Virtual DOM (lightweight copy)
• Only changed parts are updated
• Improves performance significantly

4. Modular Architecture
• Application is divided into modules
• Only required modules are loaded
Lazy Loading → Load only required data
Eager Loading → Load everything at once

5. One-Way Data Binding
• Data flows from parent to child
• Easy debugging
• Better control and predictable behavior

6. Reusability & Maintainability
• Same component can be reused multiple times
• Easy maintenance of large applications
Final Summary
• React is a UI Library
• React Native builds mobile apps (APK & iOS)
• JSX improves readability
• Virtual DOM improves performance
• Modular and component-based
• Uses one-way data binding
