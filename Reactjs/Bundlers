📌 FAQ: What are Bundlers?
🔹 Bundler – Definition

A bundler is a software tool used by developers to:

Build applications

Combine multiple files into optimized bundles

Set up the development environment based on project requirements

🔹 Popular Bundling Tools

Some commonly used bundlers are:

Webpack

Parcel

Vite

🔹 What is Scaffolding?

Scaffolding is the process of automatically generating files and folders

It creates a ready-to-use project structure

Saves development time

📌 The concept of scaffolding was originally introduced by:

Ruby / Ruby on Rails

🚀 Creating a New React App using Vite Bundler
Step 1️⃣ Open Terminal / Command Prompt

Navigate to any location where you want to create the project.

Step 2️⃣ Run the Command
npm create vite@latest app-name

Step 3️⃣ Select Options

Select framework → React

Select variant → JavaScript

Experimental rollout → No

Install dependencies → Yes

📌 Note:

After installation, the project may start automatically

You can stop it using Ctrl + C

node_modules
  - Contains all installed dependency files

public
  - Contains static resources (images, documents, icons)

src
  - Contains dynamic resources (React components, logic)

eslint.config.js
  - JavaScript code quality & linting rules

package-lock.json
  - Dependency lock file (used in production, should not be modified)

README.md
  - Project documentation written by developers

vite.config.js
  - Vite bundler configuration file

index.html
  - Application startup (entry) page

▶️ Running the React Application

Command:
npm run dev

URL:
http://localhost:5173


Run the following command in terminal:

npm run dev


Open browser and visit:

http://localhost:5173

🔄 React Application Flow (High Level)
Step-by-Step Flow

1️⃣ Client requests the React application from browser

http://localhost:5173


2️⃣ Browser loads index.html

Triggered using DOMContentLoaded event

3️⃣ index.html loads Static DOM

4️⃣ main.jsx loads all dependencies

React

ReactDOM

App component

5️⃣ React creates a Virtual DOM

createRoot()


6️⃣ React renders the App component

App.jsx


7️⃣ Virtual DOM updates the Actual DOM

8️⃣ Static DOM is transformed into Dynamic DOM

🧠 Key Points to Remember (Interview / Exam)

Vite is a fast modern bundler

Bundlers use scaffolding

index.html is the entry point

main.jsx connects React to the DOM

React uses Virtual DOM for performance

React 19 recommends function components

createRoot() is mandatory in React 18+

✅ Final Summary

👉 React 19 + Vite provides:

Faster development

Clean project structure

Better performance

Modern tooling

Easy scalability
