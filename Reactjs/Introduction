ReactJS – Complete Study Notes

What is React?
• React is a JavaScript Library
• Used to build interactive User Interfaces (UI)
• Mainly used for Frontend Web Development
• Focuses only on the View layer
• React does NOT control full application flow
React = UI only

Can React Alone Build an APK?
No. React alone cannot build Android APK.
For Mobile Apps, React Native is required.

Why Does React Need a Framework?
React does not provide routing, server-side rendering, or app flow management. Frameworks like
Next.js and Remix provide these features.

Angular vs React
React:
• JavaScript Library
• Lightweight and fast
• UI focused
Angular:
• Full Framework
• Heavy but powerful
• Controls full application flow

Library vs Framework
Library (React): Small, UI-focused, developer controls flow
Framework (Angular/Next.js): Large, full app control

SPA and PWA
SPA (Single Page Application): One page, fast, smooth navigation
PWA (Progressive Web App): App-like, offline support, better performance

Final Conclusion
• React is a UI Library
• Angular is a full Framework
• React alone cannot build APK
• Companies expect knowledge of both
• SPA & PWA solve modern web challenges
